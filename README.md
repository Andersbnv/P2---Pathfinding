# P2---Pathfinding
P2 projekt - B2-28
Name: Routeoptimization for Danske Fragtmænd
Version: 1.0

Desciption: This program solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a customized algorithm called greedy 2-opt. The algorithm finds an approximate solution given a set of 33 destinations, which is Danske Fragtmænd's maximum truck capacity.  

Features: The program executes a interactable UI. The interface has the options to create new locations, delete locations, move locations and calculate a route. The algorithm to calculate the route uses a interface implementation, so its easy to change. The program is able to read all comma seperated files, with list of locations in EUC-2D. 

System reqiurements: Able to run a .Net solution in Visual Studio. 

Install: go to P2---Pathfinding-GUI-OPTIMIZED\GUI_DFM, and open the solution "GUI_DFM.sln" in Visual Studio, thereafter run the program.
